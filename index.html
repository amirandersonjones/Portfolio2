                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong><small>CARPE DIEM!</small></strong>
                <p>Hello to ALL visitors! My name is Amir. I am currently learning coding to puruse a career in software development. I have absolutely NO EXPERIENCE in coding. Well, I'm lying, I took 2 very basic 8 week courses at Ivy Tech in Indiana. However, the vast majority of my working career has been in something completely opposite(truck driving). I think today's weather here in Chicago can probably attest to why I am looking for a career change! lol. I do have a B.A. in political science and criminal justice. I am a huge question asker(if that is a logical term). I like to problem solve and often get frustrated when people don't like to answer my million and one question. I thought, it pursuit of answers, I could apply that skill here in programming. I enjoy computers and looking at pretty websites, but eventually I would like to know how to put those things together! By this pre-work, I see that I am going to be pulling my hair out already!! no worries...I am up for the challenge!
            
                    I am working on Windows operating system. I have no experience with macs, but intend to eventually fill my way around that as well. Outside of work I enjoy horror films and cooking with my LOVE.</p>

                <p> Beyong the things that I have mentioned, I am a dog lover. However, I have not yet welcomed a fury companion into my forever home. I do however, have an African Sideneck turtle who I have
                    owned for about 5 years. I find him/her(as I am unsure of it's sex) to be very calming. I often stare at it for hours
                    as a means of self-care. I have also dabbled in a side business of baking and selling dog treats with my fiance.

                <p><em>Underneath our feet we find.Those branches and thorns a grind.
                    Why is so life so mean
                    It is as if no other scene. 
                    Through life, you know, you will find
                    We sometimes just close our minds.
                    Those solutions we so desperately want
                    All appear like yesterdays many tyrants.</em></p>
